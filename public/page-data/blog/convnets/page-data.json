Red in first channel, green in second, blue in the third.</p>\n<p>These 3 channels or matrices come together to give us different colours, each element of the matrix denotes a pixel value ranging from 0 to 255.</p>\n<p>Gray-scale Images have one channel in them, in further discussion, when I refer to image, it is a gray-scale image.</p>\n<h3>Why not use just traditional neural networks?</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ehZ7LhczF1rANBM5dcmXPg.png\" alt=\"Image Credit : DLpng\"><em>Image Credit : <a href=\"https://dlpng.com/png/6033845\">DLpng</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>Input Size</strong>: For every small increase in the size of the input matrix, the number of parameters that have to be trained in the network increases greatly.</p>\n<p>For Example: If we had an image size of <strong>150 x 150 x 3</strong>, indicating a 150 x 150 image with 3 colour channels, we would have to train <strong>67,500 parameters</strong>, but for a <strong>160 x 160 x 3</strong> image we would have to train <strong>76,800 parameters</strong>. That’s around 9000 parameters for the addition of just 10 pixels on each side!</p>\n<p>These are just small images, most images we deal with in Deep Learning problems are easily over 500 pixels in height and width. Training these many parameters will eventually lead to over-fitting and increased training times.</p>\n<p><strong>Spatial and Translation Variance:</strong> A traditional neural network can’t gives different outputs for the cat in the bottom left corner of the picture and the same cat in the top right corner of the picture. This is a major drawback since, we cannot possibly train the model on every single variation of the picture!</p>\n<p>It is just not feasible!</p>\n<p>That’s the reason why we need Convolutional Neural Networks…</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2510/1*F2Ik_XFzmu5jZF-byiAKQQ.jpeg\" alt=\"Images Source — Google\"><em>Images Source — Google</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CNN’s are the visual cortex of the deep learning world.

So, its time to start believing in yourself, now continue this article with this refreshing thought.</p>\n<p>The filters are optimised by the Back propagation algorithm.</p>\n<p>Filters can be applied on multiple channels too,</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ECr1NlqLymjiExU0Ue5J9g.png\" alt=\"Actual Representation of a Filter in a CNN, C = No. of channels and F = Kernel Size, defined by us. : Images Source — Google\"><em>Actual Representation of a Filter in a CNN, C = No. of channels and F = Kernel Size, defined by us. : Images Source — Google</em></p>\n<p>You might have noticed that, filters reduce the image’s size, causing unwanted shrinking of the image, which <strong>might also result in the loss of data in the boundaries of the image</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*aJTCU26VdtLQG3-_JX3M9Q.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>In the first image, the padding is ‘valid’</strong>, the other 3 images have a padding as ‘same’.

The no. of parameters must be reduced if possible, in order to reduce computational pressure. This also allows the model to be <strong>even more spatially invariant, since we are discarding any remaining spatial data</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*u7f0kRKQnpDAbF_EWdFTCw.png\" alt=\"Images Source — Google\"><em>Images Source — Google</em></p>\n<p>This operation is also done by moving kernels over the feature map.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*lhiWMFM8tw4s-a2FOdn3RA.png\" alt=\"How stride affects the size of the output : Images Source — Google\"><em>How stride affects the size of the output : Images Source — Google</em></p>\n<p><strong>Max Pooling</strong> selects the <strong>brightest pixel</strong>, and therefore <strong>emphasising the sharp edges</strong> in the images. It works well for images with a black or dark background, where there will be a sharp drop in the distribution of pixel values in the kernel.</p>\n<p><strong>Average Pooling</strong> outputs the average and <strong>smooths out the image</strong>, it is doesn’t do a great job in detecting sharp edges, but most of the image data is preserved, since nothing is eliminated and all values in the kernel are involved in the operation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>If we want to reduce dimensions anyway, why do we use padding?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Simple, Pooling doesn’t cause as much data loss, it almost never. But, when dimensionality reduces by filters, the valuable data in the boundaries is lost, this is uncontrollable, without padding, whereas, <strong>Pooling is controlled by us by addition and removal of pooling layers.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Activation : ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Why ReLU?</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*jOU3PnNiB0YIH1Y_t-iXng.png\" alt=\"F(x) = max(0,x) : Images Source — Google\"><em>F(x) = max(0,x) : Images Source — Google</em></p>\n<p>The ReLU function completely <strong>eliminates the possibility of negative values in the filters</strong>. It <strong>acts and looks like a linear function</strong> when the input is above zero, but its <strong>non-linearity is visible only when the input value is less than zero</strong>.</p>\n<p>This property of the ReLU unlike all other activation function makes it possible for the model to <strong>learn complex relationships in the data</strong>.</p>\n<p>Networks that use the rectifier function for the hidden layers are referred to as rectified networks.</p>\n<p>ReLU also is easy to code, and is <strong>faster to implement</strong> in Neural Networks, which implies, lesser computational requirements.</p>\n<p>It has been found that rectifying non-linearity is the single most important factor in improving recognition accuracy of the model.</p>\n<p>All this makes ReLU suitable for CNN’s.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Finally, the fully connected layers,</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*N8Drw_7X7OTSINgzhOydpw.png\" alt=\"Images Source — Google\"><em>Images Source — Google</em></p>\n<p>The <strong>Flatten layer is a simple process where the 2D matrix is converted to a 1D Matrix for giving it as an input for the Fully Connected layers.</strong></p>\n<p>The Fully Connected Layer is just a normal Feed-Forward Neural network that gives as output a set of “n” probabilities for an input image being a part of one of “n” classes.
