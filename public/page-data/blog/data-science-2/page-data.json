Both come under the category of intelligence.</p>\n<p>So piece of code that is able to mimic human intelligence can be called artificial intelligence but they all vary in the degree of intelligence they have and can be categorized in this manner.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Define Machine Learning,</strong></em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence, which involves using data in order to increase the accuracy of the results generated by the algorithm, without human intervention in the process of learning from the data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Machine Learning algorithms optimize themselves to be better based on the data provided to them, you can note the clear line of difference here,</p>\n<p>Machine Learning Algorithms are a far more complex algorithms, which have a higher level of autonomy compared to a calculator, though both are artificially intelligent.</p>\n<p>They are used on a wide range of tasks such as scam filtering or computer vision.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Machine Learning can be divided into three classes :</strong></em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Supervised Learning</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unsupervised Learning</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reinforcement Learning</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em><strong>Supervised Learning :</strong></em></p>\n<p>Supervised Learning refers to a class of Machine Learning the Algorithm learns to map a set of input features to a target variable.</p>\n<p>Mostly the need for supervised learning will occur if we have a defined set of features and a target variable like in the dataset given below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*0mSZoJPEJxEjh5mjkVdKjA.png\" alt=\"Pima Indian Diabetes Database⁴\"><em>Pima Indian Diabetes Database⁴</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each row in the data-set represents a data sample, in our case each sample is a female at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.\nEach Column represents a feature used to describe every person.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example,</p>\n<p>Patient 0 — has had 6 Pregnancies, Glucose level of 148, Blood Pressure of 72 and so on…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Our problem statement —</h1>\n<h1>Given all of the features data of a female of at least 21 years old of Pima Indian Heritage except the outcome. Calculate the outcome,</h1>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Outcome of 1 represents that the patient has diabetes, and 0 suggests that the person doesn’t have diabetes.</p>\n<p>So, we’re given the above dataset to train our machine learning model to perform this task.</p>\n<p>We start by splitting the dataset into features-target pairs.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">features = ['Pregnancies','Glucose','BloodPressure','SkinThickness','Insulin','BMI','DiabetesPedigreeFunction','Age']\n\ntarget = ['Outcome']\n\n# for Patient 0 the feature-target pair will be:\n\nfeatures = [6,148,72,35,0,33.6,0.627,50]\ntarget-label = [1]\n\nand so on for all other patients...</code></pre></div>\n<p>Our dataset consists of 5 rows, out of which we will use 3 to train the model. This data is called the training data.</p>\n<p>We reserve the remaining 2 columns in order to test the model’s accuracy in telling us whether the patient has diabetes or not. This data is called the testing data.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*vDFuZeSO2UgQ026tiIE7VQ.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The model takes the first features-label pair.</p>\n<p>Trains on it,and learns that for such and such values of features, the value of the target-label is…1 or 0 and so on…</p>\n<p>and then takes the second features-label pair and does the same on this too.</p>\n<p>In the end the model which has been exposed to 3 features label pairs knows to an extent how to map the features’ values to the value of the target.</p>\n<p>Then on the test data, we predict results for the model and check if the model has learnt how to map the features to the target(outcome) properly or not.</p>\n<p>If you have any feedback leave them in the comments, hope you are able to understand what I have written, if not post any doubt in the comments, I’ll try my best to answer them.</p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence\">https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence</a></p>\n<p>[2]Nils J.
