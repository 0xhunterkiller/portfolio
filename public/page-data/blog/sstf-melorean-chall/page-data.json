He left a note and then disappeared. Help to decode it.</p>\n<p>There seems to have been problem that was related to something linear in the SCTF 2021 meLorean Challenge.</p>\n<p>As a person who works with data on a day to day basis, I related to the dataset in terms of Linear Regression almost immediately.</p>\n<p>I thought of each letter as a dataset and when I plotted the coordinates on each list as their own graph, I got lines.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*kPpZoR8HIi21hrxBwhit9g.png\" alt=\"figure 1\"><em>figure 1</em></p>\n<p>So, I thought, why not fit all such lines into a linear regression model and find out their coefficients.</p>\n<p>I got this idea by randomly examining 2 coordinates of numbers in the first list.</p>\n<p>(67,5801) and (0,240)</p>\n<p>f(0) = 240 (Inference(If **f **is a linear equation) is that Bias = 240)</p>\n<p>f(67) = 5801</p>\n<p>5801–240 = 5561, which is also 67*83, so I stumbled upon the value of the coefficient of this line, but the other coordinates in the same list did not match.</p>\n<p>There was some level of deviation from the line, which is also clearly visible on figure 1.</p>\n<p>So, rounding off is necessary.</p>\n<p>I created a data frame in pandas for each list of coordinates.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*AOSmQhcutEehiLyx9XoZOw.png\" alt=\"Data Frame for the first set\"><em>Data Frame for the first set</em></p>\n<p>I fit these data frames on a model of their own and got the model’s coefficients.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*RRXWpARPzlnBir7HVUT_sQ.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>All I had to do was round them off now and convert to ASCII.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Euo7gY2MQX2WTXiry9ccjw.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Replacing the ASCII Characters we get the flag.</p>\n<p>Here’s my code:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*7xC0XorS4WZmwNyTRJVeHQ.png\" alt=\"\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"SSTF 2021 — meLorean Challenge","tags":["ctf"],"date":"August 17, 2021","description":null}},"prev":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Evolution of the Society — What Next?"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/evolution-of-the-society/"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Residual Networks"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/resnets/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/sstf-melorean-chall/","prevSlug":"/blog/evolution-of-the-society/","nextSlug":"/blog/resnets/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2555585279","3159585216","642215718"]}
