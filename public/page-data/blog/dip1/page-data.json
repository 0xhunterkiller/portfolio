What form do they exist in?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ybfjlwDfxtFvQpYNw_9Fcw.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Note: This series assumes that you have a intermediate level understanding of Python, and a basic level understanding Linear Algebra (esp. Matrices and Matrix Operations) and Calculus.</p>\n<p>Images are everywhere, starting from X-Rays used to save people’s physical lives to memes that are used to save their mental lives.</p>\n<p>Being blind in this beautiful world is a very depressing thing indeed, so why let the computers miss out on the fun ?</p>\n<p>One might argue that, that’s why cameras exist, but the thing about it is, cameras only help us capture the image data and put it into a frame or a computer. You can view it, but it means nothing to the computer. To a computer, all images are simply matrices.</p>\n<p>If you keep zoom in to an image, you might start seeing squares all over your image. These squares are pixels. Each Pixel has 3 channels.</p>\n<p>In a R.G.B image, the 3 channels are [Red, Blue, Green]. The colour of the pixel is a mixture of the red, blue and green channels.</p>\n<p>If the Red Channel has a value of 1 and the other 2 channels have a value of 0. Then the pixel will be Red in colour. Most computers have pixel colour values ranging from 0 to 255(uint8). Some might have them range from 0 to 65535(uint16).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>White — [255,255,255]\nBlack — [0,0,0]\nRed — [255,0,0]\nGreen — [0,255,0]\nBlue — [0,0,255]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*dYkCOoHM8mmOQQaX6zh_BQ.jpeg\" alt=\"This is the image we’ll work on! — PC Suraj Nukala\"><em>This is the image we’ll work on! — PC Suraj Nukala</em></p>\n<p>We start by importing the required packages…</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np</code></pre></div>\n<p>We read the image using the ‘pyplot’ inbuilt function,</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">img = plt.imread(‘asuma.jpg’)</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now, the img variable has the data of the image, ‘asuma.jpg’</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*oyq8CYhrQDam-EiH3ni6Dw.png\" alt=\"This is a numpy array, of the first 5 rows and columns in the image.\"><em>This is a numpy array, of the first 5 rows and columns in the image.</em></p>\n<p>Numpy is a Python Library that helps one work with Linear Algebra, Matrices and Fourier Transforms. It was created in 2005 as an open-source project by Travis Oliphant. It remains one of the standard libraries in the field of Data Science.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*02XjuT2MV7L5ey5dudKA0w.png\" alt=\"The Image size is 1080 x 1920, but what is the 3?, it is the number of channels.\"><em>The Image size is 1080 x 1920, but what is the 3?, it is the number of channels.</em></p>\n<p>Let us look at the pixel on the 1000th row and 500th column, and check if it is grey in colour.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*rSyjY4ZO1PV-A1Ccdy0g_g.png\" alt=\"We were right!

SciPy is also a good alternative.</p>\n<p>SK-Image does not allow video-processing in realtime, but opencv does. OpenCV is also faster than skimage, but has lesser pre-implemented algorithms. Pillow is the standard library for image processing in python.</p>\n<p>Thank you, do leave your feedback in the comments.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Intro to Image Manipulation","tags":["image-processing"],"date":"June 01, 2021","description":null}},"prev":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Why Image Processing?"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/dip2/"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"What are Convolutional Neural Networks?"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/convnets/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/dip1/","prevSlug":"/blog/dip2/","nextSlug":"/blog/convnets/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2555585279","3159585216","642215718"]}
