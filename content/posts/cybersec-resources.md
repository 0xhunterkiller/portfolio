I am glad to find so many people in my college being interested in Cyber Security. I would like to assure you that you have come to the right place to start your journey in this field. Let's cut the introduction short and get to the point, I hope we'll get to know each other better as time progresses. This WhatsApp group is to help you learn and get better in your domain(s) of interest in Cyber Security.

So, what are these domains I am talking about?

## Malware Analysis

    Malware analysis is the process of understanding the behavior and purpose of a suspicious file or URL. The output of the analysis aids in the detection and mitigation of the potential threat.

## Digital Forensics and Incident Response

    Digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) is a specialized field focused on identifying, remediating, and investigating cyber security incidents. Digital forensics includes collecting, preserving, and analyzing forensic evidence to paint a full, detailed picture of events.

## Reverse Engineering

    Reverse engineering covers a broad range of areas, including decompiling and disassembling of executable files and libraries, and analysis of system data. In the field of computer security, reverse engineering is used to study malware activity and create tools to neutralize it.

### Resources :

The Reversing Secrets of a Reverse Engineer book is pretty good, especially the 3 indexes in the back of the book.

## Binary Exploitation

    Binary exploitation is the process of subverting a compiled application such that it violates some trust boundary in a way that is advantageous to you, the attacker. In this module we are going to focus on memory corruption.

## Security Operations Center

    A security operations center — commonly referred to as a SOC — is a team that continuously monitors and analyzes the security procedures of an organization. It also defends against security breaches and actively isolates and mitigates security risks

## Web Application Pentesting

    Web application penetration testing involves a methodological series of steps aimed at gathering information about the target system, finding vulnerabilities or faults in them, researching for exploits that will succeed against those faults or vulnerabilities and compromise the web application.

## Cryptography

    Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents. The term is derived from the Greek word kryptos, which means hidden.
